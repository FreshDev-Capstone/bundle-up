# [TECH] Cross-Platform Development Setup & Configuration

## Task Description

Establish a robust development environment for cross-platform development including Expo mobile app, Vite web frontend, Express backend, and shared component architecture.

## Technical Requirements

- Expo + React Native for mobile development
- Vite + React for web frontend
- Express + TypeScript backend with PostgreSQL
- Shared type definitions and utilities
- Development tooling and configuration

## Platform Scope

- [x] Mobile Development (Expo/React Native)
- [x] Web Development (Vite/React)
- [x] Backend Development (Express/TypeScript)
- [x] Shared Libraries and Types
- [x] Development Tooling

## Implementation Details

- [x] TypeScript configuration for React Native
- [x] ESLint and development tooling
- [x] Navigation setup (Expo Router)
- [x] Authentication context and providers
- [x] API integration utilities
- [x] Environment configuration (.env handling)

### Web Setup (Vite + React)

- [x] Vite build configuration
- [x] TypeScript + React setup
- [x] ESLint configuration matching mobile
- [x] Responsive CSS and styling system
- [x] API client configuration
- [x] Asset handling and optimization

### Backend Setup (Express + TypeScript)

- [x] Express server with TypeScript
- [x] Knex.js database integration
- [x] PostgreSQL configuration
- [x] CORS setup for cross-platform access
- [x] Environment variable management
- [x] API route structure and controllers
- [x] Database migrations and seeding

### Shared Architecture

- [x] `/shared` directory for common code
- [x] TypeScript type definitions
- [x] API endpoint constants
- [x] Utility functions and helpers
- [x] Validation schemas

### Development Infrastructure

- [x] Network accessibility via tunneling
- [x] LocalTunnel for backend API access
- [x] Expo tunnel for mobile device testing
- [x] CORS configuration for development
- [x] Environment variable management
- [x] Hot reload and development servers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Mobile app runs on physical devices and simulators
- [x] Web app accessible from browsers
- [x] Backend API accessible from both platforms
- [x] Shared types work across all platforms
- [x] Development servers with hot reload
- [x] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [x] ESLint passes on all platforms
- [x] Database accessible and migrations work
- [x] Network configuration allows device testing
