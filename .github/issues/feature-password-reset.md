# [FEATURE] Password Reset Flow

## Feature Description

Implement secure password reset functionality via email with proper token validation and expiration.

## User Story

As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account.

## Platform

- [x] Web
- [x] Mobile
- [x] Backend

## Reset Flow

1. User enters email on forgot password page
2. System sends reset email with secure token
3. User clicks link in email
