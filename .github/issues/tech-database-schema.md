# [TECH] Database Schema Design & Migrations

## Task Description

Design and implement a comprehensive database schema for the Bundle Up grocery delivery platform, including users, products, and foundational tables with proper relationships and constraints.

## Technical Requirements

- PostgreSQL database with Knex.js migrations
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Data validation and constraints
- Scalable schema design for future features

## Platform Scope

- [x] Backend Database
- [x] Migration System
- [x] Data Seeding
- [x] Schema Documentation

## Implementation Details

### Core Tables Implemented

- [x] **Users Table** - Authentication and profile data

  - Email, password hashing, role constraints
  - Company name for B2B users
  - Google OAuth integration fields
  - Created/updated timestamps

- [x] **Products Table** - Product catalog data
  - Name, description, category fields
  - Retail and wholesale pricing
  - Image URLs with fallback handling
  - Inventory and availability tracking
  - Proper indexing for performance

### Migration Files Created

- [x] `001_create_users_table.ts` - Initial user schema
- [x] `002_create_products_table.ts` - Product catalog schema
- [x] `20250709181458_fix_products_table.ts` - Schema refinements
- [x] Additional migrations for user fields (companyName, role constraints)

### Data Seeding

- [x] `001_products.ts` - Comprehensive egg product catalog
  - 15+ different egg varieties
  - Realistic pricing for B2B/B2C
  - Product descriptions and categories
  - Image URLs with fallback handling

### Schema Features

- [x] Proper data types and constraints
- [x] Foreign key relationships
- [x] Unique constraints for business logic
- [x] Index optimization for queries
- [x] camelCase column naming for consistency
- [x] Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)

## Future Schema Planned

- [ ] **Orders** - Order management and tracking
- [ ] **Cart Items** - Persistent shopping cart
- [ ] **Order Items** - Individual order line items
- [ ] **Addresses** - Delivery addresses for users
- [ ] **Categories** - Product categorization system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All migrations run successfully
- [x] Tables created with proper constraints
- [x] Sample data seeded correctly
- [x] Foreign key relationships established
- [x] Database accessible from application
- [x] Proper indexing for performance
- [x] Consistent naming conventions
- [x] Data validation at database level

## Priority

**High** - ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Estimated Effort

**Medium** (1 sprint) - ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Files Created

- `/backend/db/migrations/` - All migration files
- `/backend/db/seeds/001_products.ts` - Product data seeding
- `/backend/knexfile.ts` - Database configuration
- `/backend/db/knex.ts` - Database connection setup

## Verification

- [x] Migrations tested and verified
- [x] Database accessible via API endpoints
- [x] Product data successfully seeded
- [x] Schema supports current application features
- [x] Ready for cart/order features expansion
