# [TECH] Implement Shared Component Library

## Task Description

Create a shared component library to maintain consistency between web and mobile platforms while reducing code duplication.

## Platform/Component

- [x] Shared Code
- [x] Web Frontend
- [x] Mobile App

## Technical Requirements

- Set up shared TypeScript types and interfaces
- Create platform-agnostic business logic utilities
- Implement shared validation schemas
- Create shared API client configurations
- Set up shared constants and configurations

## Shared Components/Utilities

```
shared/
├── types/           # TypeScript interfaces
├── utils/           # Business logic utilities
├── validation/      # Form validation schemas
├── constants/       # App constants
