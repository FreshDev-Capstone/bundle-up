# Bundle Up - Issues Fixed Summary

## Problems Resolved âœ…

### 1. **Fixed "Unexpected text node" Error**
- **Issue**: Text content was split across multiple lines in ProductCard admin price display
- **Solution**: Combined all text into a single line within the Text component
- **File**: `mobile/components/product/ProductCard/ProductCard.tsx`

### 2. **Fixed Image Loading Errors**
- **Issue**: Using Unsplash photo page URLs instead of direct image URLs
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated seed data with proper direct image URLs
  - Enhanced `getImageUrl` utility to convert Unsplash URLs automatically
  - Simplified ProductCard to use single image display instead of carousel to avoid complexity
  - Added fallback placeholder images
- **Files**: 
  - `backend/db/seeds/001_products.ts`
  - `mobile/utils/imageUtils.ts`
  - `mobile/components/product/ProductCard/ProductCard.tsx`

### 3. **Changed Header Logo from "BundleUp" to "SFI"**
- **Issue**: Green circle showed "BundleUp" text
- **Solution**: Changed fallback text to "SFI"
- **File**: `mobile/screens/products/ProductsScreen.tsx`

### 4. **Fixed Category Filter Z-Index Issue**
- **Issue**: Category filters were hidden behind the product count display
- **Solution**: Added `zIndex: 10` and `elevation: 3` to category container
- **File**: `mobile/screens/products/ProductsScreen.styles.ts`

### 5. **Simplified ProductCard Component**
- **Issue**: Complex carousel implementation causing rendering issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed FlatList carousel implementation
  - Show only first image with proper `resizeMode="cover"`
  - Removed unused state and handlers
  - Cleaned up imports
- **File**: `mobile/components/product/ProductCard/ProductCard.tsx`
